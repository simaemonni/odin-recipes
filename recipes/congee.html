    <p>I will be removing my wisdom teeth in a couple days and heard that you should avoid solid foods for a while. In preparation, I will be sharing the most basic congee recipe with everyone!</p>
    <p>Congee is sort of like rice soup. Some like theirs a little more watery and some prefer a thicker viscosity. It is also an incredibly accommodating dish--add whatever kind of meat, vegetable and seasoning you'd like.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>10-12 cups water or stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice in advance and then soak with clean water for 30 minutes. Mix with 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable cooking oil or sesame oil. Set aside for 15 minutes. You can freeze the rice in the previous day after soaking to reduce the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boiling in a pot and then add the soaked rice. Heat until boiling again and slow down the fire and continue cooking for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you want the rice to be well broken, stir the porridge during the cooking in one direction in the last 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite sides and garnishes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
